# gmt-app-expo
Expo versions of the re-written GMT1 and GMT2 apps

GMT 1 and GMT 2 were my first ever apps, written natively in Objective C,
then again in Java for android.

After many years, Apple requires the apps to be updated to newer code.

It became more time-efficient to simply re-write the apps in react native
instead of updating the original apps.

This code will be re-used for GMT1 and GMT2, just simply changing the assets and styles

This architecture is
- React for UI only
- Redux for state management and all business logic 
- Expo Wrapping Everything
